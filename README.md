This is a simple and cheap bench power supply.
It is based on the following components :
- 12V/5A main DC power supply : One designed to power led strip
- DC/DC converter buck/boost converter, sepic kind. Look for LTC3780 Automatic Buck Boost Constant Current Power Module. 
- INA219 to measure voltage/current (x2 if you are lazy)
- Relay
- Nokia 5110 style LCD screen
- MCP4725 12 bits DAC to give the current limiting value

Schematics are in the "schematic" folder

The main features are :
- Current and voltage report (accuracy Â ~ 10 mV/ 10 mA)
- Connect/Disconnect output load
- ~ 5 A max
- from 1v to ~30v
- Current limiting (min is ~ 50 mA)
